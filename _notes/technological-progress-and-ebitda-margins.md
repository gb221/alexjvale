title: Technological progress and EBITDA margins

Industries are essentially games. Each industry has players competing to take similar inputs and produce similar outputs - faster and cheaper than everyone else. The inputs, rules, and outputs differ within each but the essence is the same.

Win the game and you’ll be rewarded handsomely.

As with all games people end up finding the best ways to win. The longer a game has been played with the same inputs, rules, and outputs, the more likely it is that the best ways to win have been found. Once everyone knows the best ways to win, everyone will begin playing like that.

-

Industry’s measurement of this is EBITDA margin. Individual industries have an uncanny way of grouping around a margin range and, just like with games, the more mature and stable an industry the tighter and more well-defined the ‘ways to win’ are.

| Industry | EBITDA margin | Maturity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grocery retail | 3-6% | Very high | Perfect competition: identical suppliers, products, locations. Almost impossible to differentiate. |
| Airlines | 5-12% | Very high | Same planes, fuel costs, routes, labor pools. Differentiation mainly in routes/slots. |
| Enterprise software | 15-35% | Medium | Product differentiation exists but cloud has standardised delivery costs. Sales/marketing spend still varies. |
| Industrial equipment | 12-25% | Medium | Mix of commodity and specialised products. R&D and scale create some advantages. |
| Crypto services | -40-70% | Low | Infrastructure still being built. Huge variance between exchanges, protocols, and services. Winner-take-all dynamics. |
| Digital health | -20-40% | Low | Still unclear which models work: pure software vs hybrid, B2C vs B2B vs B2B2C all being tested. |

Now what happens when the game changes?

Look at airlines. In the 1960s airliner technology was essentially linear. Want fly 5x more people? You’ll need to buy 5x more planes.

| Aircraft model | Year | Passengers | Operating cost/hr | Cost per seat/hr |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boeing 707-320B | 1959 | 140-189 | $1,000 | $6.30 |
| DC-8-63 | 1966 | 150-189 | $1,100 | $6.40 |

Airlines could compete on route selection, in-flight services, and safety reputations but the biggest contributor to their game was fixed.

And then in 1968 Boeing introduced a new technology to the game: the 747.

| Aircraft model | Year | Passengers | Operating cost/hr | Cost per seat/hr |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boeing 707-320B | 1959 | 140-189 | $1,000 | $6.30 |
| DC-8-63 | 1966 | 150-189 | $1,100 | $6.40 |
| Boeing 747-100 | 1968 | 366-452 | $1,700 | $4.20 |

Now all of a sudden airlines could fly people at 66% of the cost they previously could’ve. Early 747 adopter’s margins expanded and they began reaping the rewards of their new game strategy.

Like any good advantage it could be manipulated and extended. Airlines with 747s transmuted their margin expansion into offering lower prices while maintaining historic margin levels. Lower prices stimulated demand and more people flew that previously couldn’t afford to.

747-equipped airlines now had cheaper prices and a growing share of the market. Other airlines were forced to match their economics and soon everyone was buying 747s.[^1]

Both the inputs and expected outputs of the airline game had changed.

-

So those that first harness changes to the game can gain a significant EBITDA margin advantage over other players, but how long does it last?

One of the most surprising things about industry is how quickly advantages disappear. They are self-levelling.

As soon as one airline showed that 747s meant outputting cheaper airfares at the same margins it was clear they were winning. If other airlines wanted to maintain their positions in the market they had better start also buying 747s.

The competition is pressured into acquiring the new advantage - or risk death. Try and name something more persuasive.

| Industry | Innovation | Year | Time to equilibrium | EBITDA delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Steel | Bessemer process | 1856 | ~10 years | +40% |
| Autos | Automated assembly line | 1913 | ~12 years | +20% |
| Shipping | Shipping containers | 1956 | ~8 years | +25% |
| Airlines | 747s | 1968 | ~4 years | +15% |
| Retail | Barcodes | 1974 | ~5 years | +12% |
| Telecom | Fiber optic cables | 1980s | ~6 years | +45% |
| Finance | Electronic trading | 1990s | ~4 years | +30% |
| Imaging | Digital photography | 1990s | ~8 years | +25% |

So what makes an industry ripe for EBITDA margin expansion? The most interesting thing about these opportunities is that they tend to appear alongside specific structural inefficiencies:

1. **High transaction costs.** Industries where a lot of value is lost in the process of doing business. Commercial real estate leasing is a classic example, ~6% of the transaction goes to brokerage fees, legal review, and documentation processing - none of these add value to the ‘matching’ of tenant to real estate space.
2. **Artificial capacity constraints.** Industries where capacity isn't really limited by physics or economics, but by organisational structure. Before container ports were standardised different loading systems and incompatible container sizes significantly reduced efficiency.
3. **Misaligned middle-men.** Industries with powerful middle-men who aren't adding value proportional to their take. Travel agents and the internet are a classic example. Agents weren't bad actors, they just weren’t necessary after the internet hit the mainstream.
4. **Hidden cross-subsidies.** When one customer group is unknowingly subsidising another, there's usually room for EBITDA expansion by segmenting properly. Enterprise software lived off this for years - the same product would cost $1M or $10K depending on the customer's size. Find the segment subsidising another, solely target them, remove the subsidy, and lower your prices.
5. **Manual processes at scale.** Any industry where humans are doing repetitive tasks at massive scale is basically asking to be disrupted. The interesting part isn't replacing the humans - it's capturing some of the savings as margin instead of passing it all to customers.

The best opportunities usually have several of these characteristics layered together. Retail stock trading pre-Robinhood had high transaction costs, unnecessary middle-men, cross-subsidies, and manual processes.

What's counterintuitive is that these inefficiencies often persist in plain sight for years. Everyone in the industry sees them, but existing players are too optimised around the current structure to be incentivised to fix them.

This might explain why outsiders often drive the biggest EBITDA expansions. They're not trying to optimise the existing system - they're building a new one that makes the inefficiencies obsolete.

The really valuable question is: which industries today have these characteristics but don't look tech-enabled yet? Those are probably where the next big margin expansion opportunities are hiding.
